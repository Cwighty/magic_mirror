# Plan

## Hardware setup

- Acquire a 2-way mirror and an LCD screen
- Connect the Raspberry Pi to the LCD screen
- Install the necessary software and drivers to interface with the LCD screen

## Wake word detection and animation

- Choose a wake word detection library such as Snowboy or PocketSphinx
- Create or acquire Sleeping Beauty themed animation assets
- Use a software tool such as Blender to create the animation
- Integrate the wake word detection library with the animation to trigger the animation when the wake word is detected

## Speech recognition and generation

- Acquire an OpenAI GPT model API key
- Choose a Python library for interfacing with the OpenAI GPT model such as OpenAI API Wrapper or Hugging Face Transformers
- Create a Python script to send the user's speech input to the OpenAI GPT model and receive a response
- Use a software tool such as Festival or eSpeak for text-to-speech synthesis
- Integrate the text-to-speech library with the Python script to generate speech output

## Mouth animation

- Acquire Sleeping Beauty themed mouth animation assets
- Use a software tool such as Blender to create the animation
- Use a Python library such as Viseme to control the mouth animation with the phonemes of the speech output

## Integration and testing

- Integrate all components of the system into a single program on the Raspberry Pi
- Test the system to ensure all components are functioning properly

Here are the estimated time requirements for each step:

- Hardware setup - 1 day
- Wake word detection and animation - 2 days
- Speech recognition and generation - 3 days
- Mouth animation - 2 days
- Integration and testing - 1 day
